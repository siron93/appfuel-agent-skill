# App Fuel Agent Endpoints

Production API base:

```text
https://new.theappfuel.com/api/elite/v1/elite
```

Authentication:

- Public documentation endpoints do not require authentication.
- Search, app detail, usage, and saved research endpoints require an authenticated App Fuel connection.
- Prefer hosted MCP OAuth. Remote MCP clients discover OAuth through `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` and `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`.
- API-key bearer auth remains available as a fallback for REST tests and MCP clients that do not support OAuth.
- If a protected endpoint returns `{"detail":"Agent authentication credentials were not provided."}`, complete the MCP OAuth login or configure a fallback API key and retry.

Public endpoints:

Query rule:

- Use `query` for whole creative-profile search inside ads or reels: scenes, claims, offers, visible UI, captions, transcripts, pain points, creator mechanics, product moments, or hook-like wording. It is not a hook-only embedding search.
- Send `query` as a string array with short focused alternatives when a user request contains several related creative concepts. Do not send one long keyword string.
- Put category, active/running status, app ids, app-level semantic constraints, account type, media type, hook type, video duration, dates, revenue, engagement, grouping, sorting, and pagination in filters or typed arguments.
- Use `app_product_query` for app product concepts, app descriptions, or jobs-to-be-done, such as "photo and video editing apps". If this already scopes the market, do not add a broad category filter unless the user asked for that category.
- Use `hook_type` only for typed hook-category labels; do not treat it as a hook-only semantic search.
- For "find Health & Fitness apps running ads", use `query=""`, `filters.category="HEALTH_AND_FITNESS"`, `filters.active_status="active"`, and `group_by="app"`.
- Paid ad search results include `overview` for immediate interpretation: hook, claim, value proposition, pain points, target personas, offer, strategy, ad description, and structure.
- For one or more specific apps, use `include_app_ids` with App Fuel app ids from `search_apps` or `app_detail`. For paid ads, use `exclude_app_ids` to remove known apps from a market scan.
- For one specific paid ad, use `ad_detail` with `public_id` (`ad_...`) from search results when available; pass it as `creative_key`. Use `similar_ads` with that same id when the user wants more creatives like it.

Common ads filters include `category`, `active_status`, `include_app_ids`, `app_product_query`, `app_semantic_limit`, `exclude_app_ids`, `media_type`, `people_gender`, `people_role`, `people_age_range`, `creative_format`, `production_quality`, `language`, `cut_speed`, `pain_intensity`, `hook_type`, `min_run_days`, `max_run_days`, `min_video_duration_seconds`, `max_video_duration_seconds`, `web_funnel`, `min_app_revenue`, `max_app_revenue`, `app_release_start`, `app_release_end`, `min_radar_average`, `radar_mins`, and `sort`.

Common reels filters include `category`, `account_type`, `include_app_ids`, `app_product_query`, `app_semantic_limit`, `language`, `hook_type`, `people_gender`, `people_age_range`, `ui_context`, `creator_mode`, `dominant_emotion`, `min_views`, `min_likes`, `min_comments`, `min_video_duration_seconds`, `max_video_duration_seconds`, `min_app_revenue`, `max_app_revenue`, `date_start`, `date_end`, `app_release_start`, `app_release_end`, and `sort`.

Pagination:

- Flat search pages return up to 50 paid creatives or organic reels. Grouped app pages return up to 20 apps, with up to 24 ads or reels per app.
- Use `pagination.next_request` when present. For grouped app results this fetches more apps through `app_offset`. To inspect more than 24 ads or reels from one selected app, make a follow-up flat request with `include_app_ids` for that app, `group_by=""`, and `offset` pagination.
- For grouped app results, the next page normally uses `app_offset`.
- For flat creative results and app search, the next page normally uses `offset`.

Set `return_view=true` when examples matter and return `view_url` to the user.

Collections are private by default. Public collections returned by `create_collection`, `update_collection`, and `list_collections` include `collection.url` when a `shareId` is available. Return that URL as the direct collection link after creating or filling a public collection. Private collections do not include a public URL.

Collection limit: a user can keep up to 20,000 saved items inside collections across all collections. When the limit is reached, moving or saving another item into a collection returns an error.

Canvas notes:

- Canvases are private by default.
- Every canvas response can include `workspaceUrl`, which opens the signed-in owner workspace.
- Public canvases include `canvas.url`, a read-only share link.
- Snapshot responses include `snapshot.svg`, `snapshot.viewBox`, `snapshot.width`, and `snapshot.height`. Pass `crop: {x, y, width, height}` to inspect one canvas-coordinate area or `crops: [{x, y, width, height}, ...]` to inspect multiple zones in one call; multi-zone responses include `snapshots`.
- Canvas nodes support `media`, `video`, `image`, `label`, `app`, `ad`, `reel`, and `html`.
- For html nodes, put safe static markup in `metadata.html`; do not include scripts.
- Use `name` in create or update requests when the user asks to name or rename a canvas.
- Use arrows (`edges`) for relationships and `groups` for themes or clusters. Arrows can attach to nodes with `fromNodeId`/`toNodeId`, use free coordinates with `start`/`end`, or mix one node endpoint with one free point.
